## Overview

This project analyzes regional energy production and renewable energy patterns to recommend the best location for Intel’s next data center. Using Tableau, I created visualizations to compare regional energy supply, renewable usage, and production stability across the U.S.

## Tools Used

Tableau

Interactive dashboards and filters

Regional energy production dataset

## What I Did

Built Tableau worksheets analyzing net production, renewable energy share, and energy trends by region

Compared renewable output and stability throughout the day

Combined visualizations into an interactive dashboard for regional comparison

Interpreted results to support a data-driven location recommendation

## Key Findings

The Northwest region produces the highest share of renewable energy.

Much of this production comes from hydropower, providing stable, high-output clean electricity.

The Northwest also shows strong net energy production, indicating reliable surplus capacity.

Compared to California, the Northwest’s renewable generation is more consistent throughout the day.

## Recommendation

The Northwest region is the most suitable location for Intel’s next data center due to its high renewable energy output, hydropower-driven stability, and strong net production capacity. These factors support both operational reliability and sustainability goals.
